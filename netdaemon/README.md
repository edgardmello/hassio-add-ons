# NetDaemon

This is the application daemon project for Home Assistant. This project makes it possible to make automations using the .NET Core (3.1) framework.

Why a new application daemon for Home Assistant? There already exists one!? The existing appdaemon is a great software and are using python as language and ecosystem. This is for people who loves to code in the .NET core ecosystem and c#. The daemon will be supported by all supported platforms of .NET core.

## Dev environment

To setup a development environment for NetDaemon please see [https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon-app-template](https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon-app-template)

If you already done that check that you have the latest version of the nuget packages. The latest release of NetDaemon has same version as packages.

The NetDaemon project can be found at [https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon](https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon)

## Pre-Alpha! Expect things to change

This is in pre-alpha experimental phase and expect API:s to change over time. Please use and contribute ideas for improvement or better yet PR:s.

Only amd64 (non arm) is currently supported but ARM devices as Raspberry PI will be supported in the near future.

The daemon is currently only distributed through Hassio add-on but a docker container and instruction to run locally will be provided in time.
